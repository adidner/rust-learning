# Why rust

Good for systems level programming like C++ rather than application level programming like C# or Java or JavaScript
C like in nature but don't have to deal with memory allocation and has good garbage collection
Strongly typed


# create project

`cargo init` or `cargo new <project name>`


# compling and running

`rustc filename.rs `
`./filename.exe`

or

`cargo run` from folder that has the cargo.toml file

cargo == npm
Cargo.toml == package.json
/target == node_packages

# Building

`cargo build`

`cargo build --release`
